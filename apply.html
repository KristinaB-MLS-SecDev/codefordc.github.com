                  <p>Some of you are already stepping up as leaders in Code for DC. Some of you have good ideas or skills that could help us improve. We’d like to recognize your contributions while building a more sustainable, successful organization.</p>
                  <p>These are the positions we feel are important to running a successful brigade. <strong>Please apply even if you meet just a few of the qualifications. We can teach you the parts you don’t know.</strong> Or we can split up the role with someone else. These are not set in stone. What’s most important is your commitment to Code for DC, our work, our mission, and our code of conduct.</p>
                  <p>Questions? Ideas? Please feel free to reach out to <a href="/about.html">Code for DC leadership</a>. We’d love to help.</p>
